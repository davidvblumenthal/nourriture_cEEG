# Motivation & Research Question

Both food intake and exercising are essential for maintaining energy balance in the human body. In order to have the best prerequisites to live a healthy life it is essential to eat and exercise in the right proportions. The monitoring of exercising is already researched well and many useful applications and devices have emerged e.g. Smart Watches, Fitness Trackers. However, the research on the monitoring of food intake ist still in the laboratory setting. 

**→ Therefore in this study we aim to detect food intake activity using an around-the-ear electrode array.**

This approach can be potentially useful for automatic and objective monitoring of ingestive behaviours with higher accuracy as practical means to treat ingestive problems.
