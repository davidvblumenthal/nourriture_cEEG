## Summary
This study presents an approach to enhance the objective monitoring of food intake using cEEGrids. A 3D-printed around-the-ear electrode array was used to acquire data of participants eating different types of food as well as baseline activities. Signals are processed using different algorithms to create feature sets and to recognize patterns of the different featured activities. The results showed that Random Forests performed best on our data set with average accuracy and f1-score of 85.7% and 85.9%. This approach can be useful to automate and objectively measure ingestive behavior. An imaginable application would be in the treatment of overweight or anorexic patients. It could also be applicable to support Alzheimer’s patients, as this disease is also often accompanied by a lack of food and fluid intake.

## Motivation & Research Question

Both food intake and exercising are essential for maintaining energy balance in the human body. In order to have the best prerequisites to live a healthy life it is essential to eat and exercise in the right proportions. The monitoring of exercising is already researched well and many useful applications and devices have emerged e.g. Smart Watches, Fitness Trackers. However, the research on the monitoring of food intake ist still in the laboratory setting. 

**→ Therefore in this study we aim to detect food intake activity using an around-the-ear electrode array.**

This approach can be potentially useful for automatic and objective monitoring of ingestive behaviours with higher accuracy as practical means to treat ingestive problems.

## Experiment Design

**Number Participants = 2-3 (2 would be us)**

**Within-subject design - Activities to collect:**

------------------------------------------------------

🚀 **Target Activities**

🍖  Eating solid food e.g. Mix of Nuts or Fitness Bars

🍜  Eating non solid food e.g. Soup

➖ **Baseline Activities**

🗣️  Speaking - reading a loud

🧘🏼‍♂️  Resting eyes open & eyes closed

🥱  Yawning 

------------------------------------------------------ 

**Order**: Speaking - Yawning - Resting EO - Resting EC - Eating NSF - Eating SF

**Break between activities**: 15 seconds
